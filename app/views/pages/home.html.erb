         <p> Hi there, I'm <strong> Kym Ha-Tran </strong>, an aspiring Full-Stack developer who has recently completed a 6 month Bootcamp with Le Wagon, Melbourne. I currently live and work in Melbourne, with an open mind to remote opportunities.</p>
         <p> I have experience and continue to further develop my skills in Ruby, CSS, Javascript, HTML, and SQL and am keen to partner with other developers or businesses that are looking to build a website or upgrade their current web pages.</p>
